Credit Card Fraud Detection Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of credit card transactions to explore data properties and prepare for fraud detection. The analysis utilizes Python with popular data manipulation, visualization, and statistical libraries.
Project Structure
Main Script

    main.py: The primary script that performs initial data loading, exploration, and summary statistics.

Key Features

    Data Loading:
        Reads the dataset (creditcard.csv) containing credit card transaction details.

    Data Exploration:
        Displays the first few rows of the dataset.
        Summarizes information such as data types, null values, and descriptive statistics.

    Statistical Analysis:
        Calculates the percentage of missing values for each column.

    Visualization (Planned/Partially Implemented):
        Sets up seaborn and matplotlib for advanced data visualization (though no visualizations are generated in the current script).

    Statistical Modeling:
        Uses statsmodels for potential statistical analysis or modeling (not implemented in the current script).

Setup Instructions

    Prerequisites:
        Python 3.x
        Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels

    Installation: Install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib statsmodels

Data: Place the dataset file (creditcard.csv) in the appropriate directory or update the file path in the script.

Run the Script: Execute the main.py script:

    python main.py

Data Overview

The dataset (creditcard.csv) includes:

    Transaction features: Various anonymized features (V1, V2, ..., Vn).
    Class labels: Indicates fraudulent (1) and non-fraudulent (0) transactions.

Future Work

    Implement data preprocessing and feature engineering.
    Develop fraud detection models.
    Evaluate model performance using classification metrics.

Notes

    The script suppresses warnings for cleaner output.
    Adjust pd.set_option for more concise or detailed table displays.

Feel free to expand or modify based on additional functionality in your project!
